Windows 98 is a classic operating system that many retro enthusiasts still enjoy using today. However, running Windows 98 on modern hardware can be challenging and require special drivers or hardware. Fortunately, there is a way to run Windows 98 on any computer using a free emulator called DOSBox-X and an IMG file of Windows 98.
 
An IMG file is a disk image that contains all the data and structure of a disk, such as a CD-ROM or a hard drive. By using an IMG file of Windows 98, you can avoid the hassle of finding and inserting a physical CD-ROM or floppy disk. You can also easily transfer files between your host system and the emulated Windows 98 system.
